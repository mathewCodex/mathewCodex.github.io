            Html5, CSS3, Javascript, Node.js"</span
          >,and also frameworks, such as Bootstrap, and React which I am
          currently learning. I believe that learning never ends, That's why
          after my 7 months of intensive study of the above Technologies which I
          have mentioned confident enough. I know that it was time for me to
          take a Bolder step of achieving the role of an
          <span class="bold-T">internship</span> as my first real life
          experience in my humble Tech journey I feel like with my basic
          understanding of the knowledge I can be able to deliver effectively,
          In an organization that its future mindset is beyond present
          imagination toward growth, and also in my responsibility, I am ready
          to achieve that goal according to my role in a fast-paced environment
          at any organization as I learn."

        in software development usually, Its was not easy starting something new
        for the first time but it is always worth it! If it a great Skills like
        this. Basically to measure the pace of how effective my learning was it
        took me, <span class="bold-T">Two months</span> and some week to get all
        the knowledge I need in HTML and CSS, Then I give another month for
        intense back-to-back Practice till  I  gain  good confidence in it."

        "I won't say am good to your Taste but I know when I am confident about a
        thing and that was HTML and CSS as a beginner. I was on a road map taking
       a lot of courses and carefully trying to grasp the whole concept, as a
        beginner on <span class="bold-T">Javascript</span>, Which I must confess
        was far different from Html and CSS from experience. I continue to make
        progress on javascript and gain basic confidence. Though it was
        challenging ðŸ¤¯,  I always have that belief of "there's no problem I
        can't solve and there's nothing  I cant do if  I am focused and dedicated
        with time" and that worked for me till this Point. Taking almost
        <span class="bold-T">four months Plus</span> to get all the basic knowledge
        and concept, I am still hungry for advanced Knowledge"

        with <span class="bold-T">mongoDB</span> as my NoSQL database..Even with
        my little knowledge I do have projects that i build using node.js, one

      <p class="Text">
        Playing <span class="bold-T">BasketBall</span> had made me understand
        the concept of team works and how everybody should know his/her  position
         to know their role when they are in possession of the
        ball,<span class="bold-T">TeamWorks</span> is very important and as a
        result either it helps to grow a Team or its falls a team, I don't really
        know much about the concept of a team in programming but what I do know is
        that the whole concept of teamwork in a game implies even in  real life
        situation as a whole. Never had a real-life team experience apart from
        basic developers like me, So it  is kind of difficult to say how it feels
        like to work with a Team in the Tech industry .but all I know is that if
        I join a team I will make my presence count by playing my role
        effectively towards the greater height of the team reputation
