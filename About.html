          ><span class="bold-T">HTML and CSS</span></a
        >, which was the first language i learnt as of anyone who is a beginner
        in software development usually,Its was not easy starting something new
        for the first time but it is always worth it! If it a great Skills like
        this. Basically to measure the pace of how effective my learning was it
        took me, <span class="bold-T">Two months</span> and some week to get all
        the knowledge i need in html and Css, Then i give another month for
        intense back to back Practice till i gain a good confidence in it.""

        "I wont say am good to your Taste but i know when i'am confident about a
        thing,and that was HTML and Css as a beginner.I was on a road map taking
        lot of courses and carfully trying to grasp the whole concept, as a
        beginner on <span class="bold-T">Javascript</span>, Which i must confess
        was far different from Html and css from experience.I continue to make
        progress on javascript and gain basic confidence.Though its was
        challenging ðŸ¤¯,But i always have that believed of "theres no problem i
        cant solve and there's nothing i cant do if i am focused and dedicated
        with time" and that worked for me till this Point .Taking almost
        <span class="bold-T">4month Plus</span> to get all the basic knowlegde
        and concept, I am still hungry for advanced Knowlegde"

        " Day and Night I was reinForcing and trying to grow my knowledge on
        web-development as a front-end dev, then on a road track got introduced
        to <span class="bold-T">node.js</span> and which i cant lie am not good
        at it compare to the above skills, although am currently learning it
        with <span class="bold-T">mongoDB</span> as my NoSQL database..Even with
        my little knowledge I do have projects that i build using node.js, one
        of them was my Blog-page which was powered by node.js with a backend and

      <p class="Text">
        Playing <span class="bold-T">BasketBall</span> had made me understand
        the concept of team works and how everybody should know there Position
        in order to know there role when they are in possession of the
        ball,<span class="bold-T">TeamWorks</span> is very important and as a
        result either it helps to grow a Team or its falls a team ,I dont really
        know much on the concept of team in programming but what i do know is
        that the whole concept of team work in a game implies to real life
        situation in a whole. Never had a real life team experience apart from
        basic developers like me,So it kind of difficult to say how it feels
        like to work with a Team in the Tech industry.But all I know is that if
        i join a team i will make my presence count by playing my role
        effectively towards geater height of the team reputation
